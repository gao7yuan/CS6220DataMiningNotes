## Decision Trees
- determine best split
  - homogeneous
  - reduce entropy of data (degree of messiness)
- which attribute to select
- information gain
  - entropy before split - entropy after split

## Rule-based Classification
- evaluating rules
  - dataset D, rule r: A -> y
    - coverage(r) = A / D
    - accuracy(r) = A & y / A
